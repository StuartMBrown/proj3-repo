MAKING CHANGES TO REPO

## Project overview - Visualization Track 
The Great Lakes Endangered Species Project focuses on raising awareness about the species in the Great Lakes region, specifically in states such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York. The project employs three main views to convey crucial information. View #1 presents a location chart showcasing the distribution of threatened, endangered, and nonessential species, using different layers to distinguish each category. View #2 offers a dynamic dashboard with dropdown options for selecting a specific state and species (including common names). This view includes a pop-up gauge plot displaying the levels of threatened, endangered, and nonessential species, along with additional information such as the listing location, images, and brief descriptions of the animals. View #3 serves as a comprehensive summary of species distribution in the Great Lakes region. By providing a comprehensive visual representation and interactive features, the project aims to shed light on the current status of these animals and promote awareness for their conservation in the Great Lakes region.

Technologies used: Python, HTML, Javascript, PostgresSQL, CSS, Jupyter Notebooks and various Python libraries

## Important Definitions 
* A "non-essential species" based of the best available information,is the experimental population not essential for the continued existence of the species.
* A “threatened species” is one that is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
* An “endangered species” is one that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
* An experimental population is a population of an endangered or threatened species that is released into the wild outside of the current range of the species with the aim of contributing to the conservation of the species.

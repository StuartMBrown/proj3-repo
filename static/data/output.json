    "description":"General Information The snuffbox is a small- to medium-sized mussel, with males reaching up to 2.8 in (7.0 cm) in length (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.  \n\nThe species historical range included Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin."

The lynx\u0092s long legs and large feet make it highly adapted for hunting in deep snow.\n\nThe distribution of lynx in North America is closely associated with the distribution of North American boreal forest.  In Canada and Alaska, lynx inhabit the classic boreal forest ecosystem known as the taiga.  The range of lynx populations extends south from the classic boreal forest zone into the subalpine forest of the western United States, and the boreal\/hardwood forest ecotone in the eastern United States.  Forests with boreal features extend south into the contiguous United States along the North Cascade and Rocky Mountain Ranges in the west, the western Great Lakes Region, and northern Maine.

The snake's belly is marbled dark gray or black and there is a narrow, white stripe on its head. Its tail has several dark brown rings and is tipped by gray-yellow horny rattles. Young snakes have the same markings, but are more vividly colored. The head is a triangular shape and the pupils are vertical. Massasaugas live in wet areas including wet prairies, marshes, fens, sedge meadows, peatlands, and low areas along rivers and lakes. Massasaugas also use adjacent uplands (shrubland, open woodlands, prairie) during part of the year. They often hibernate in crayfish burrows but may also be found under logs and tree roots or in small mammal burrows.

    "description":"General Information The rayed bean is a small mussel, usually less than 1.5 inches (in) (3.8 centimeters (cm)) in length (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244; West et al. 2000, p. 248).  The shell outline is elongate or ovate in males and elliptical in females, and moderately inflated in both sexes, but more so in females (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The valves are thick and solid.  The anterior end is rounded in females and bluntly pointed in males (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  Females are generally smaller than males (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  Dorsally, the shell margin is straight, while the ventral margin is straight to slightly curved (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The beaks are slightly elevated above the hingeline (West et al. 2000, p. 248), with sculpture consisting of double loops with some nodules (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  No posterior ridge is evident.  Surface texture is smooth and sub-shiny, and green, yellowish-green, or brown in color, with numerous, wavy, dark-green rays of various widths (sometimes obscure in older, blackened specimens) (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142; West et al. 2000, p. 248).  Internally, the left valve has two pseudocardinal teeth (tooth-like structures along the hingeline of the internal portion of the shell) that are triangular, relatively heavy, and large, and two short, heavy lateral teeth (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The right valve has a low, triangular pseudocardinal tooth, with possibly smaller secondary teeth anteriorly and posteriorly, and a short, heavy, and somewhat elevated lateral tooth (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The color of the nacre (mother-of-pearl) is silvery white or bluish and iridescent posteriorly.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the rayed bean from other mussels are its small size, thick valves, unusually heavy teeth for a small mussel, and color pattern (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia."

    "description":"General Information Northeastern bulrush, first described as a new species by A.E. Schuyler in 1962, is a leafy, perennial herb approximately 80-120 centimeters in height. The lowermost leaves are up to 8 millimeters (mm) wide and 40-60 times as long as wide, while the uppermost leaves are 3-5 mm wide and 30-50 times as long as wide (Schuyler 1962). Flowering culms (stems) are produced from short, woody, underground rhizomes. The umbellate inflorescence has distinctly arching rays, which bear clusters of brown spikelets (small, elongated flower clusters). Each of the minute flowers has six small (1.1-1.7 mm long), rigid perianth bristles, and each bristle is armed with thickwalled, sharply pointed barbs projecting downward. Flowers have 0-3 stamens and a 3- parted style. The yellow-brown achenes (Figure 2) are 1.10-1.35 mm long, obovate, and tough and thickened above the seed (Schuyler 1962). Flowering occurs from mid-June to July, and fruit sets between July and September (Crow 1982).The species historical range included Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia."

The dark brown or black carapace may be marked with radiating light lines or a light blotch on the vertebral and pleural scutes. Scute annuli are usually prominent in juvenile and young adult specimens, but the carapace may be nearly smooth in old adults. The head, neck, and limbs are typically dark brown with variable reddish to yellow spots and streaks. A large reddish-orange to yellow blotch is visible behind and above each tympanum, sometimes merging into a continuous band on the neck. The upper jaw is weakly notched. (Ernst, Lovich, and Barbour, 1994; Harding, 1997)\n\nThe plastron is also brown or black, but often with lighter yellow blotches towards the medial and anterior scute edges. A mature male bog turtle has a concave plastron and a long, thick tail, with the vent posterior to the rear edge of the carapace with tail extended.

    "description":"General Information The rabbitsfoot is a medium to large mussel, elongate and rectangular, reaching 12 cm (6 inches) in length (Oesch 1984).  Parmalee and Bogan (1998) describe the beaks as moderately elevated and raised only slightly above the hinge line.  Beak sculpture consists of a few strong ridges or folds continuing onto the newer growth of the umbo (raised or domed part of the dorsal margin of the shell) as small tubercles (small, rounded projection on surface of the shell).  Shell sculpture consists of a few large, rounded, low tubercles on the posterior slope, although some individuals will have numerous small, elongated pustules (small raised spots) particularly on the anterior.  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish, greenish, or olive in color becoming darker and yellowish\u0096brown with age and usually covered with dark green or nearly black chevrons and triangles pointed ventrally (Say 1817).  These patterns are absent in some individuals. \n \nInternally, the color of the nacre is white and iridescent, often with a grayish\u0096green tinge in the umbo cavity.  Specimens from the southern periphery of its range are occasionally purplish.  Soft parts generally have an orange coloration (Oesch 1984; Parmalee and Bogan 1998).  However, Vidrine (1993) noted that the rabbitsfoot in the Ouachita River system in Louisiana had black soft parts.  Aspects of the soft anatomy are described by Ortmann (1912), Utterback (1915), Davis and Fuller (1981), and Oesch (1984).\nThe species historical range included Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia."

Richardson in 1905 based on a study of nine specimens collected from the Mississippi River near Grafton, Illinois (Forbes and Richardson 1905). They named this new species Parascaphirhynchus albus.  Later reclassification assigned it to the genus Scaphirhynchus where it has remained (Bailey and Cross 1954; Campton et al. 2000).\n\nPallid sturgeon have a flattened shovel-shaped snout; a long, slender, and completely armored caudal peduncle (the tapered portion of the body which terminates at the tail); and lack a spiracle (small openings found on each side of the head) (Forbes and Richardson 1905).  As with other sturgeon, the mouth is toothless, protrusible (capable of being extended and withdrawn from its natural position), and ventrally positioned under the head.  The skeletal structure is primarily composed of cartilage rather than bone.

2,https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/758,Whooping crane,Minnesota,https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc3703-250px-thumbnail.jpg,Endangered,,"General InformationThe whooping crane occurs only in North America and is North AmericaÂ’s tallest bird, with males approaching 1.5 m (5 ft) when standing erect. The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo. The total population of wild and captive whooping cranes in July, 2010, was 535.

The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.

17,https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp/species/3652,Canada Lynx,Minnesota,https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/species_images/doc4979-250px-thumbnail.jpg,,Threatened,"General InformationThe lynx is a medium-sized cat with long legs, large, well-furred paws, long tufts on the ears, and a short, black-tipped tail.  The winter pelage of the lynx is dense and has a grizzled appearance with grayish-brown mixed with buff or pale brown fur on the back, and grayish-white or buff-white fur on the belly, legs and feet.  Summer pelage of the lynx is more reddish to gray-brown.  Adult males average 10 kilograms (22 pounds) in weight and 85 centimeters (33.5 inches) in length (head to tail), and females average 8.5 kilograms (19 pounds) and 82 centimeters (32 inches).  The lynxÂ’s long legs and large feet make it highly adapted for hunting in deep snow.

The distribution of lynx in North America is closely associated with the distribution of North American boreal forest.  In Canada and Alaska, lynx inhabit the classic boreal forest ecosystem known as the taiga.  The range of lynx populations extends south from the classic boreal forest zone into the subalpine forest of the western United States, and the boreal/hardwood forest ecotone in the eastern United States.  Forests with boreal features extend south into the contiguous United States along the North Cascade and Rocky Mountain Ranges in the west, the western Great Lakes Region, and northern Maine.  Within these general forest types, lynx are most likely to persist in areas that receive deep snow and have high-density populations of snowshoe hares, the principal prey of lynx.

The wide range of habitats in which wolves can thrive reflects their adaptability as a species, and includes temperate forests, mountains, tundra, taiga, and grasslands. Gray wolves were originally listed as subspecies or as regional populations of subspecies in the contiguous United States and Mexico. In 1978, we reclassified the gray wolf as an endangered population at the species level (C. lupus) throughout the contiguous United States and Mexico, except for the Minnesota gray wolf population, which was classified as threatened. Gray wolf populations in Idaho and Montana were delisted due to recovery in 2011.The species historical range included Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.

As its name suggests, this bat is distinguished by its long ears, particularly as compared to other bats in its genus, Myotis, which are actually bats noted for their small ears (Myotis means mouse-eared).

The northern long-eared bat is found across much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic coast west to the southern Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia. The speciesÂ’ range includes 37 states.

White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease known to affect bats, is currently the predominant threat to this bat, especially throughout the Northeast where the species has declined by up to 99 percent from pre-white-nose syndrome levels at many hibernation sites.  Although the disease has not yet spread throughout the northern long-eared batÂ’s entire range (white-nose syndrome is currently found in at least 25 of 37 states where the northern long-eared bat occurs), it continues to spread.  Experts expect that where it spreads, it will have the same impact as seen in the Northeast.

The snake's belly is marbled dark gray or black and there is a narrow, white stripe on its head. Its tail has several dark brown rings and is tipped by gray-yellow horny rattles. Young snakes have the same markings, but are more vividly colored. The head is a triangular shape and the pupils are vertical. Massasaugas live in wet areas including wet prairies, marshes, fens, sedge meadows, peatlands, and low areas along rivers and lakes. Massasaugas also use adjacent uplands (shrubland, open woodlands, prairie) during part of the year. They often hibernate in crayfish burrows but may also be found under logs and tree roots or in small mammal burrows. Unlike other rattlesnakes, massasaugas hibernate alone.The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.

The beaks are slightly elevated above the hingeline (West et al. 2000, p. 248), with sculpture consisting of double loops with some nodules (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  No posterior ridge is evident.  Surface texture is smooth and sub-shiny, and green, yellowish-green, or brown in color, with numerous, wavy, dark-green rays of various widths (sometimes obscure in older, blackened specimens) (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142; West et al. 2000, p. 248).  Internally, the left valve has two pseudocardinal teeth (tooth-like structures along the hingeline of the internal portion of the shell) that are triangular, relatively heavy, and large, and two short, heavy lateral teeth (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The right valve has a low, triangular pseudocardinal tooth, with possibly smaller secondary teeth anteriorly and posteriorly, and a short, heavy, and somewhat elevated lateral tooth (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The color of the nacre (mother-of-pearl) is silvery white or bluish and iridescent posteriorly.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the rayed bean from other mussels are its small size, thick valves, unusually heavy teeth for a small mussel, and color pattern (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia.

The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.

As its name suggests, this bat is distinguished by its long ears, particularly as compared to other bats in its genus, Myotis, which are actually bats noted for their small ears (Myotis means mouse-eared).

The northern long-eared bat is found across much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic coast west to the southern Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia. The speciesÂ’ range includes 37 states.

White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease known to affect bats, is currently the predominant threat to this bat, especially throughout the Northeast where the species has declined by up to 99 percent from pre-white-nose syndrome levels at many hibernation sites.  Although the disease has not yet spread throughout the northern long-eared batÂ’s entire range (white-nose syndrome is currently found in at least 25 of 37 states where the northern long-eared bat occurs), it continues to spread.  Experts expect that where it spreads, it will have the same impact as seen in the Northeast.

Scute annuli are usually prominent in juvenile and young adult specimens, but the carapace may be nearly smooth in old adults. The head, neck, and limbs are typically dark brown with variable reddish to yellow spots and streaks. A large reddish-orange to yellow blotch is visible behind and above each tympanum, sometimes merging into a continuous band on the neck. The upper jaw is weakly notched. (Ernst, Lovich, and Barbour, 1994; Harding, 1997)

The plastron is also brown or black, but often with lighter yellow blotches towards the medial and anterior scute edges. A mature male bog turtle has a concave plastron and a long, thick tail, with the vent posterior to the rear edge of the carapace with tail extended.

The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo.

The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.

A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson in 1905 based on a study of nine specimens collected from the Mississippi River near Grafton, Illinois (Forbes and Richardson 1905). They named this new species Parascaphirhynchus albus.  Later reclassification assigned it to the genus Scaphirhynchus where it has remained (Bailey and Cross 1954; Campton et al. 2000).

Pallid sturgeon have a flattened shovel-shaped snout; a long, slender, and completely armored caudal peduncle (the tapered portion of the body which terminates at the tail); and lack a spiracle (small openings found on each side of the head) (Forbes and Richardson 1905).  As with other sturgeon, the mouth is toothless, protrusible (capable of being extended and withdrawn from its natural position), and ventrally positioned under the head.  The skeletal structure is primarily composed of cartilage rather than bone.

As its name suggests, this bat is distinguished by its long ears, particularly as compared to other bats in its genus, Myotis, which are actually bats noted for their small ears (Myotis means mouse-eared).

The northern long-eared bat is found across much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic coast west to the southern Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia. The speciesÂ’ range includes 37 states.

White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease known to affect bats, is currently the predominant threat to this bat, especially throughout the Northeast where the species has declined by up to 99 percent from pre-white-nose syndrome levels at many hibernation sites.  Although the disease has not yet spread throughout the northern long-eared batÂ’s entire range (white-nose syndrome is currently found in at least 25 of 37 states where the northern long-eared bat occurs), it continues to spread.  Experts expect that where it spreads, it will have the same impact as seen in the Northeast.

The snake's belly is marbled dark gray or black and there is a narrow, white stripe on its head. Its tail has several dark brown rings and is tipped by gray-yellow horny rattles. Young snakes have the same markings, but are more vividly colored. The head is a triangular shape and the pupils are vertical. Massasaugas live in wet areas including wet prairies, marshes, fens, sedge meadows, peatlands, and low areas along rivers and lakes. Massasaugas also use adjacent uplands (shrubland, open woodlands, prairie) during part of the year. They often hibernate in crayfish burrows but may also be found under logs and tree roots or in small mammal burrows.

The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo. The total population of wild and captive whooping cranes in July, 2010, was 535.

The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo.

The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.

The winter pelage of the lynx is dense and has a grizzled appearance with grayish-brown mixed with buff or pale brown fur on the back, and grayish-white or buff-white fur on the belly, legs and feet.  Summer pelage of the lynx is more reddish to gray-brown.  Adult males average 10 kilograms (22 pounds) in weight and 85 centimeters (33.5 inches) in length (head to tail), and females average 8.5 kilograms (19 pounds) and 82 centimeters (32 inches).  The lynxÂ’s long legs and large feet make it highly adapted for hunting in deep snow.

The distribution of lynx in North America is closely associated with the distribution of North American boreal forest.  In Canada and Alaska, lynx inhabit the classic boreal forest ecosystem known as the taiga.  The range of lynx populations extends south from the classic boreal forest zone into the subalpine forest of the western United States, and the boreal/hardwood forest ecotone in the eastern United States.  Forests with boreal features extend south into the contiguous United States along the North Cascade and Rocky Mountain Ranges in the west, the western Great Lakes Region, and northern Maine.  Within these general forest types, lynx are most likely to persist in areas that receive deep snow and have high-density populations of snowshoe hares, the principal prey of lynx.

The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo. The total population of wild and captive whooping cranes in July, 2010, was 535.

The shell outline is elongate or ovate in males and elliptical in females, and moderately inflated in both sexes, but more so in females (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The valves are thick and solid.  The anterior end is rounded in females and bluntly pointed in males (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  Females are generally smaller than males (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  Dorsally, the shell margin is straight, while the ventral margin is straight to slightly curved (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The beaks are slightly elevated above the hingeline (West et al. 2000, p. 248), with sculpture consisting of double loops with some nodules (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  No posterior ridge is evident.  Surface texture is smooth and sub-shiny, and green, yellowish-green, or brown in color, with numerous, wavy, dark-green rays of various widths (sometimes obscure in older, blackened specimens) (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142; West et al. 2000, p. 248).  Internally, the left valve has two pseudocardinal teeth (tooth-like structures along the hingeline of the internal portion of the shell) that are triangular, relatively heavy, and large, and two short, heavy lateral teeth (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The right valve has a low, triangular pseudocardinal tooth, with possibly smaller secondary teeth anteriorly and posteriorly, and a short, heavy, and somewhat elevated lateral tooth (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The color of the nacre (mother-of-pearl) is silvery white or bluish and iridescent posteriorly.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the rayed bean from other mussels are its small size, thick valves, unusually heavy teeth for a small mussel, and color pattern (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia.

The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.

The shell outline is elongate or ovate in males and elliptical in females, and moderately inflated in both sexes, but more so in females (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The valves are thick and solid.  The anterior end is rounded in females and bluntly pointed in males (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  Females are generally smaller than males (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  Dorsally, the shell margin is straight, while the ventral margin is straight to slightly curved (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The beaks are slightly elevated above the hingeline (West et al. 2000, p. 248), with sculpture consisting of double loops with some nodules (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  No posterior ridge is evident.  Surface texture is smooth and sub-shiny, and green, yellowish-green, or brown in color, with numerous, wavy, dark-green rays of various widths (sometimes obscure in older, blackened specimens) (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142; West et al. 2000, p. 248).  Internally, the left valve has two pseudocardinal teeth (tooth-like structures along the hingeline of the internal portion of the shell) that are triangular, relatively heavy, and large, and two short, heavy lateral teeth (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The right valve has a low, triangular pseudocardinal tooth, with possibly smaller secondary teeth anteriorly and posteriorly, and a short, heavy, and somewhat elevated lateral tooth (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The color of the nacre (mother-of-pearl) is silvery white or bluish and iridescent posteriorly.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the rayed bean from other mussels are its small size, thick valves, unusually heavy teeth for a small mussel, and color pattern (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia.

The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.

As its name suggests, this bat is distinguished by its long ears, particularly as compared to other bats in its genus, Myotis, which are actually bats noted for their small ears (Myotis means mouse-eared).

The northern long-eared bat is found across much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic coast west to the southern Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia. The speciesÂ’ range includes 37 states.

White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease known to affect bats, is currently the predominant threat to this bat, especially throughout the Northeast where the species has declined by up to 99 percent from pre-white-nose syndrome levels at many hibernation sites.  Although the disease has not yet spread throughout the northern long-eared batÂ’s entire range (white-nose syndrome is currently found in at least 25 of 37 states where the northern long-eared bat occurs), it continues to spread.  Experts expect that where it spreads, it will have the same impact as seen in the Northeast.

Adult carapace length is 7.9 to 11.4 cm (3.1 to 4.5 inches). The dark brown or black carapace may be marked with radiating light lines or a light blotch on the vertebral and pleural scutes. Scute annuli are usually prominent in juvenile and young adult specimens, but the carapace may be nearly smooth in old adults. The head, neck, and limbs are typically dark brown with variable reddish to yellow spots and streaks. A large reddish-orange to yellow blotch is visible behind and above each tympanum, sometimes merging into a continuous band on the neck. The upper jaw is weakly notched. (Ernst, Lovich, and Barbour, 1994; Harding, 1997)

The plastron is also brown or black, but often with lighter yellow blotches towards the medial and anterior scute edges. A mature male bog turtle has a concave plastron and a long, thick tail, with the vent posterior to the rear edge of the carapace with tail extended. The female has a flat plastron and a thinner, smaller tail, with the vent at or beneath the rear carapace edge. (Ernst, Lovich, and Barbour, 1994; Harding, 1997)

The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name ""whooping crane"" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.

Whooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo.

The winter pelage of the lynx is dense and has a grizzled appearance with grayish-brown mixed with buff or pale brown fur on the back, and grayish-white or buff-white fur on the belly, legs and feet.  Summer pelage of the lynx is more reddish to gray-brown.  Adult males average 10 kilograms (22 pounds) in weight and 85 centimeters (33.5 inches) in length (head to tail), and females average 8.5 kilograms (19 pounds) and 82 centimeters (32 inches).  The lynxÂ’s long legs and large feet make it highly adapted for hunting in deep snow.

The distribution of lynx in North America is closely associated with the distribution of North American boreal forest.  In Canada and Alaska, lynx inhabit the classic boreal forest ecosystem known as the taiga.  The range of lynx populations extends south from the classic boreal forest zone into the subalpine forest of the western United States, and the boreal/hardwood forest ecotone in the eastern United States.  Forests with boreal features extend south into the contiguous United States along the North Cascade and Rocky Mountain Ranges in the west, the western Great Lakes Region, and northern Maine.  Within these general forest types, lynx are most likely to persist in areas that receive deep snow and have high-density populations of snowshoe hares, the principal prey of lynx.

In 1978, we reclassified the gray wolf as an endangered population at the species level (C. lupus) throughout the contiguous United States and Mexico, except for the Minnesota gray wolf population, which was classified as threatened. Gray wolf populations in Idaho and Montana were delisted due to recovery in 2011.The species historical range included Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.

As its name suggests, this bat is distinguished by its long ears, particularly as compared to other bats in its genus, Myotis, which are actually bats noted for their small ears (Myotis means mouse-eared).

The northern long-eared bat is found across much of the eastern and north central United States and all Canadian provinces from the Atlantic coast west to the southern Northwest Territories and eastern British Columbia. The speciesÂ’ range includes 37 states.

White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease known to affect bats, is currently the predominant threat to this bat, especially throughout the Northeast where the species has declined by up to 99 percent from pre-white-nose syndrome levels at many hibernation sites.  Although the disease has not yet spread throughout the northern long-eared batÂ’s entire range (white-nose syndrome is currently found in at least 25 of 37 states where the northern long-eared bat occurs), it continues to spread.  Experts expect that where it spreads, it will have the same impact as seen in the Northeast.  The species historical range included Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.

The average length of an adult is about 2 feet. Adult massasaugas are gray or light brown with large, light-edged chocolate brown blotches on the back and smaller blotches on the sides. The snake's belly is marbled dark gray or black and there is a narrow, white stripe on its head. Its tail has several dark brown rings and is tipped by gray-yellow horny rattles. Young snakes have the same markings, but are more vividly colored. The head is a triangular shape and the pupils are vertical. Massasaugas live in wet areas including wet prairies, marshes, fens, sedge meadows, peatlands, and low areas along rivers and lakes. Massasaugas also use adjacent uplands (shrubland, open woodlands, prairie) during part of the year. They often hibernate in crayfish burrows but may also be found under logs and tree roots or in small mammal burrows. Unlike other rattlesnakes, massasaugas hibernate alone.The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.

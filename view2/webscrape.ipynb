      "    \"description\":\"General InformationThe whooping crane occurs only in North America and is North America\\u0092s tallest bird, with males approaching 1.5 m (5 ft) when standing erect. The whooping crane adult plumage is snowy white except for black primaries, black or grayish alula (specialized feathers attached to the upper leading end of the wing), sparse black bristly feathers on the carmine crown and malar region (side of the head from the bill to the angle of the jaw), and a dark gray-black wedge-shaped patch on the nape.  The common name \\\"whooping crane\\\" probably originated from the loud, single-note vocalization given repeatedly by the birds when they are alarmed. Whooping cranes are a long-lived species; current estimates suggest a maximum longevity in the wild of at least 30 years.\\n\\nWhooping cranes currently exist in the wild at 3 locations and in captivity at 12 sites. The July 2010 total wild population was estimated at 383.  There is only one self-sustaining wild population, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo National Park population, which nests in Wood Buffalo National Park and adjacent areas in Canada, and winters in coastal marshes in Texas at Aransas.  In addition, there is a small captive-raised, non-migratory population in central Florida, and a small migratory population of individuals introduced beginning in 2001 that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida in an eastern migratory population. The last remaining wild bird in the reintroduced Rocky Mountain Population died in the spring of 2002. The captive population contained 152 birds in July, 2010, with annual production from the Calgary Zoo, International Crane Foundation, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Audubon Species Survival Center, and the San Antonio Zoo. The total population of wild and captive whooping cranes in July, 2010, was 535.\\nThe species historical range included Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming.

The maximum length of females is about 1.8 in (4.5 cm) (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The shape of the shell is somewhat triangular (females), oblong, or ovate (males), with the valves solid, thick, and very inflated.  The beaks are located somewhat anterior of the middle, and are swollen, turned forward and inward, and extended above the hingeline (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  Beak sculpture consists of three or four faint, double-looped bars (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162; Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 108).  The anterior end of the shell is rounded, and the posterior end is truncated, highly so in females.  The posterior ridge is prominent, being high and rounded, while the posterior slope is widely flattened.  The posterior ridge and slope in females is covered with fine ridges and grooves, and the posterioventral shell edge is finely toothed (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 162).  The ventral margin is slightly rounded in males and nearly straight in females.  Females have recurved denticles (downward curved tooth-like structures) on the posterior shell margin that aid in holding host fish (Barnhart 2008, p. 1).  The periostracum (external shell surface) is generally smooth and yellowish or yellowish-green in young individuals, becoming darker with age.  Green, squarish, triangular, or chevron-shaped marks cover the umbone (the inflated area of the shell along the dorsal margin), but become poorly delineated stripes with age.  Internally, the left valve has two high, thin, triangular, emarginate pseudocardinal teeth (the front tooth being thinner than the back tooth) and two short, strong, slightly curved, and finely striated lateral teeth.  The right valve has a high, triangular pseudocardinal tooth with a single short, erect, and heavy lateral tooth.  The interdentum (a flattened area between the pseudocardinal and lateral teeth) is absent, and the beak cavity is wide and deep.  The color of the nacre is white, often with a silvery luster, and a gray-blue or gray-green tinge in the beak cavity.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the snuffbox from other species include its unique color pattern, shape (especially in females), and high degree of inflation.  \\n\\nThe species historical range included Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin.

The shell outline is elongate or ovate in males and elliptical in females, and moderately inflated in both sexes, but more so in females (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The valves are thick and solid.  The anterior end is rounded in females and bluntly pointed in males (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  Females are generally smaller than males (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  Dorsally, the shell margin is straight, while the ventral margin is straight to slightly curved (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The beaks are slightly elevated above the hingeline (West et al. 2000, p. 248), with sculpture consisting of double loops with some nodules (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  No posterior ridge is evident.  Surface texture is smooth and sub-shiny, and green, yellowish-green, or brown in color, with numerous, wavy, dark-green rays of various widths (sometimes obscure in older, blackened specimens) (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142; West et al. 2000, p. 248).  Internally, the left valve has two pseudocardinal teeth (tooth-like structures along the hingeline of the internal portion of the shell) that are triangular, relatively heavy, and large, and two short, heavy lateral teeth (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).  The right valve has a low, triangular pseudocardinal tooth, with possibly smaller secondary teeth anteriorly and posteriorly, and a short, heavy, and somewhat elevated lateral tooth (Parmalee and Bogan 1998, p. 244).  The color of the nacre (mother-of-pearl) is silvery white or bluish and iridescent posteriorly.  Key characters useful for distinguishing the rayed bean from other mussels are its small size, thick valves, unusually heavy teeth for a small mussel, and color pattern (Cummings and Mayer 1992, p. 142).The species historical range included Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia.

The lowermost leaves are up to 8 millimeters (mm) wide and 40-60 times as long as wide, while the uppermost leaves are 3-5 mm wide and 30-50 times as long as wide (Schuyler 1962). Flowering culms (stems) are produced from short, woody, underground rhizomes. The umbellate inflorescence has distinctly arching rays, which bear clusters of brown spikelets (small, elongated flower clusters). Each of the minute flowers has six small (1.1-1.7 mm long), rigid perianth bristles, and each bristle is armed with thickwalled, sharply pointed barbs projecting downward. Flowers have 0-3 stamens and a 3- parted style. The yellow-brown achenes (Figure 2) are 1.10-1.35 mm long, obovate, and tough and thickened above the seed (Schuyler 1962). Flowering occurs from mid-June to July, and fruit sets between July and September (Crow 1982).The species historical range included Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia.

Richardson in 1905 based on a study of nine specimens collected from the Mississippi River near Grafton, Illinois (Forbes and Richardson 1905). They named this new species Parascaphirhynchus albus.  Later reclassification assigned it to the genus Scaphirhynchus where it has remained (Bailey and Cross 1954; Campton et al. 2000).\\n\\nPallid sturgeon have a flattened shovel-shaped snout; a long, slender, and completely armored caudal peduncle (the tapered portion of the body which terminates at the tail); and lack a spiracle (small openings found on each side of the head) (Forbes and Richardson 1905).  As with other sturgeon, the mouth is toothless, protrusible (capable of being extended and withdrawn from its natural position), and ventrally positioned under the head.  The skeletal structure is primarily composed of cartilage rather than bone. The species historical range included Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wyoming.
